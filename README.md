# Code Sharing Clubs

## Features

This is a code-sharing VS Code extension aimed at teachers and trainers at schools or companies to help them manage students better. It allows you to see the student's code and files opened and to modify them in real-time.

The extension is meant to be plug-and-play, very easy to set up and to use. It offers commands for starting a code-sharing server, editing a participant's document and starting a code-sharing client for the participant's computers, with automatic server discovery on the local-area network.

WARNING: Work in progress, may not contain full functionality or be secure from exploits.

## Requirements & Installation

As this is a W.I.P. it is not currently available on the VS Code extension market.

### 1.0.0

Initial release expected in mid February.
